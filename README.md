# Arctic-XBeach
Coupled thermo-morphodynamic model for Arctic permafrost coastlines, combining XBeach hydrodynamics with an enthalpy-based thermal erosion module

## Overview
Arctic-XBeach couples the XBeach morphodynamic model with an enthalpy-based thermal erosion module to simulate coastal retreat processes in permafrost environments. The model uses an innovative event-driven approach that executes erosion calculations only during storms when thawed sediment is available, improving computational efficiency while maintaining physical realism.

## Key Features
- **Coupled approach**: Integrates XBeach hydrodynamics with permafrost thaw processes
- **Enthalpy-based thermal module**: Robust handling of phase change in frozen sediments
- **Event-driven methodology**: Storm-focused calculations optimize computational performance
- **Arctic-specific**: Designed for permafrost coastlines experiencing rapid climate change

## Status
🚧 **In Development** - This model is currently under active development. A manuscript describing the model formulation and validation is in preparation for submission to Geoscientific Model Development (GMD).

## Case Study
The model has been developed and tested for Barter Island, Alaska, leveraging well-documented permafrost characteristics and observational datasets for validation.

## Installation

### Step 1: Create environment and clone repository

```bash
# Create conda environment with Python and git
conda create -n arctic-xbeach python=3.12 git -y
conda activate arctic-xbeach

# Enable long paths (Windows only, run once)
git config --global core.longpaths true

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/deltares-research/arctic-xbeach.git
cd arctic-xbeach
```

### Step 2: Install Python dependencies

```bash
# Install package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install XBeach Python toolbox
pip install git+https://github.com/openearth/xbeach-toolbox.git
```

### Step 3: Download XBeach executable
XBeach must be installed separately. Download from the official repository: https://download.deltares.nl/xbeach


**Installation:**
1. Download the appropriate version for your system
2. Extract to a location of your choice
3. Note the path to the executable:
4. Update your run configuration (`config.yaml`) with this path:
   ```yaml
   xbeach:
     version: "C:/software/XBeach/xbeach.exe"  # Use forward slashes
   ```

### Step 4: Download case study data
```bash
# From the arctic-xbeach directory
python download_data.py
```

This downloads the Barter Island forcing data (~ERA5 and storm datasets) to:
```
examples/case_studies/barter_island/database/
├── era5.csv      # ERA5 reanalysis forcing data
└── storms.csv    # Storm/wave conditions
```

**Manual download** (if script fails):
- [era5.csv](https://deltares-usa-software.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/arctic_xbeach/database_barter_island/era5.csv)
- [storms.csv](https://deltares-usa-software.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/arctic_xbeach/database_barter_island/storms.csv)

Place files in: `examples/case_studies/barter_island/database/`

### Step 5: Verify installation
```bash
python -c "from arctic_xbeach.model import Simulation; print('✓ Arctic-XBeach installed successfully!')"
```

---

## Quick Start
```python
from arctic_xbeach.model import Simulation

# Initialize simulation
sim = Simulation("examples/case_studies/barter_island")

# Run model
from main import main
main(sim)
```

Or from command line:

```bash
python main.py examples/case_studies/barter_island
```
